I've been using [Coolify](https://coolify.io) in my Homelab for a couple years now, and I have never enjoyed self hosting this much before.

Gone are the days of manually managing all of your subdomains and certificates in [Cloudflare](https://thehomelab.wiki/books/dns-reverse-proxy/page/setup-your-domain-with-cloudflare) and [Nginx Proxy Manager](https://nginxproxymanager.com), just setup a wildcard, and Coolify will handle the rest.

But it doesn't just handle SSL and domain management — it's a full open-source PaaS (Platform as a Service) that makes deploying apps, databases, and services effortless.

## Why Coolify?

With Coolify you can:

- **Deploy any app or service** — from static sites and APIs to full-stack apps built with Next.js, Remix, Nuxt, or SvelteKit. You can even spin up databases, WordPress, Ghost, Plausible Analytics, and more in just a couple clicks.
- **Run it anywhere** — your own VPS, Raspberry Pi, Hetzner, AWS, or even a laptop. If it supports Docker, Coolify can manage it.
- **Push to deploy** — connect a GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket repo and every push can auto-deploy. Pair it with pull request previews and you've got a smooth workflow for testing before merging.  
- **Stay secure automatically** — free Let's Encrypt SSL for all your custom domains, with automatic renewals.  
- **Keep your data safe** — one-click database backups to any S3-compatible storage.  
- **Collaborate with ease** — invite teammates, assign roles, and share access safely.  

And Coolify is fully self-hosted. That means **no vendor lock-in**, full control of your data, and the ability to move servers or providers whenever you like.

## Performance and Experience

Performance has been excellent in my Homelab — deployments finish fast, the real-time terminal is responsive, and monitoring tools keep me aware of server health and disk usage at a glance. 

I have deployed a number of personal sites, projects, and other services through it for domains I own.

Some examples:
- [LukeHagar.com](https://lukehagar.com)
- [OpenAPI Definition Generator](https://oas-def-gen.lukehagar.com)
- [OpenAPI.gg](https://openapi.gg)
- [pypistats.dev](https://pypistats.dev)


If you're looking for a way to simplify your self-hosting setup without giving up control, I can't recommend Coolify enough. 

It's been rock solid for me, and I'm genuinely excited to see where the project goes as it continues to evolve (Direct Multi-Server support is confirmed on the roadmap 👀).
